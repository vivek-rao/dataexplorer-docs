# has_cs_ operator

Filters a record set for data with a case-sensitive search string.

The following table provides a comparison of the `has` operators:

|Operator   |Description   |Case-Sensitive  |Example (yields `true`)  |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------------|
|[`has`](has-operator.md) |Right-hand-side (RHS) is a whole term in left-hand-side (LHS) |No |`"North America" has "america"`|
|[`!has`](not-has-operator.md) |RHS isn't a full term in LHS |No |`"North America" !has "amer"`|
|[`has_cs`](has-cs-operator.md) |RHS is a whole term in LHS |Yes |`"North America" has_cs "America"`|
|[`!has_cs`](not-has-cs-operator.md) |RHS isn't a full term in LHS |Yes |`"North America" !has_cs "amer"`|

> [!NOTE]
> The following abbreviations are used in the table above:
>
> * RHS = right hand side of the expression
> * LHS = left hand side of the expression

For further information about other operators and to determine which operator is most appropriate for your query, see [datatype string operators](datatypes-string-operators.md). 

Case-insensitive operators are currently supported only for ASCII-text. For non-ASCII comparison, use the [tolower()](tolowerfunction.md) function.

## Performance tips

> [!NOTE]
> Performance depends on the type of search and the structure of the data.

For faster results, use the case-sensitive version of an operator, for example, `has_cs`, not `has`. For best practices, see [Query best practices](best-practices.md).

## Syntax

*T* `|` `where` *col* `has_cs` `(`*expression*`)`   

## Arguments

* *T* - The tabular input whose records are to be filtered.
* *col* - The column to filter.
* *expression* - Scalar or literal expression.

## Returns

Rows in *T* for which the predicate is `true`.

## Example

<!-- csl: https://help.kusto.windows.net/Samples -->
```kusto
StormEvents
    | summarize event_count=count() by State
    | where State has_cs "New"
    | count
```

**Output**

|Count|
